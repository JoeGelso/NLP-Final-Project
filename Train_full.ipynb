We propose that taking half of the train examples, and shuffling the endings around randomly should suffice, but it also seems likely that this may not give the kind of dataset that would be ideal. Stories marked as incoherent will presumably have endings that are completely unrelated to the origianl story. This will contrast with the premade false endings in our test dataset, which will seem much more likely as possible coherent endings in comparison to the modified train set stories. Our prediction is that the accuracy will not be great."
